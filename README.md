Skyrim Finance is the First Multichain Decentralized Structured Finance Marketplace. Skyrim Finance aims to build the Robo-Advisor of the DeFi ecosystem. The objective of Skyrim Finance is to help investors of different profiles have risk-adjusted returns through fixed-rate and leveraged-yield DeFi products.



## Overview

The DeFi market consists of two types of DeFi investors. We aim to create a blended product that fits  between these two target markets, so that participants can have a single touch hedged approach to DeFi.

- **Senior Token(Fixed-rate APY)**: There are many crypto holders seeking for the fixed-rate APY without standard risk.
- **Junior Token(Leveraged APY)**: There are many yield farmers seeking higher yield farming APY with high leverage.

The objective of Skyrim Finance is to help investors of different profiles have risk-adjusted return through fixed-rate and leveraged-yield DeFi products.
